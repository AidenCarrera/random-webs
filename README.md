# Random Webs

Random Webs is my collection of small interactive websites built with Next.js. Every page explores a different idea, from music tools and visualizers to simulations, games, and other experiments that I thought would be fun to build.

The home page sends you to a random site and keeps track of the ones you've already visited. All site information lives in a single registry that's also used to generate metadata, the sitemap, validation scripts, and automated tests.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 and React 19
- TypeScript 6
- Tailwind CSS 4 and CSS Modules
- Tone.js and Framer Motion
- Three.js and Matter.js
- Playwright

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x (`.node-version` contains `24`)
- pnpm 11.x (the project pins pnpm 11.12.0)
- FFmpeg on `PATH` if you plan to normalize audio

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AidenCarrera/random-webs.git
cd random-webs
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The development server runs at http://localhost:3000.

To make the development server available to phones and other devices on your local network, run:

```bash
pnpm dev:mobile
```

Then open `http://<your-computer's-local-IP>:3000` on the other device. Your firewall may prompt you to allow Node.js access to private networks.

For local metadata and origin settings, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.

## Testing

Install Playwright's Chromium browser after installing dependencies:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

`pnpm test:smoke` reuses a running development server or starts one on port 3100. It checks every registered site for a successful response, a document title, console errors, and uncaught page errors. There are also interaction tests for Fractal Explorer, Olo Terminal, Solar System, and Zen Garden.

```bash
# Limit the registry-wide route checks to sites changed since HEAD
pnpm test:smoke --changed

# Test a server that is already running
pnpm test:smoke --base-url http://localhost:3000

# Pass options through to Playwright
pnpm test:smoke --headed

# Build and test the production server
pnpm test:smoke:production
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs a frozen install, formatting, linting, type checking, website validation, a production build, and the Chromium smoke tests on pushes and pull requests. The smoke tests run against the production build made earlier in the job.

## Opening sites manually

Start the development server first, then run one of these commands:

```bash
# Open every registered site
pnpm open:websites

# Open sites with staged, unstaged, or untracked changes
pnpm open:websites --changed

# Print the changed URLs without opening them
pnpm open:websites --changed --dry-run

# Point the script at another server
pnpm open:websites --base-url http://localhost:3100
```

The changed-site check watches `src/app/<route>/` and `public/<route>/`.

## Adding a site

1. Create `src/app/<route>/page.tsx`. Route names must use lowercase kebab-case.
2. Create `src/app/<route>/layout.tsx` and call `createWebsiteMetadata("/<route>")`.
3. Add the site to `WEBSITES` in `src/lib/websites.ts`. Include its path, title, blurb, accent classes, SEO title, and description.
4. Put route-specific public files in `public/<route>/`. Shared fonts belong in `public/fonts/`.
5. Use Tailwind for small styles and `styles.module.css` for route-specific CSS.
6. Run `pnpm check` and the relevant smoke tests.

Every registered site needs both `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx`. `pnpm validate:websites` catches missing files, metadata mismatches, duplicate paths, and unregistered routes. `/dev` is the only page route intentionally left out of the registry.

## Developer index

`/dev` shows an alphabetical list of every registered site. It's hidden from search indexing and can be unlocked with `olo`. The browser remembers the unlock, making it easier to test.

## Audio normalization

`pnpm normalize:lofi` processes top-level `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, and `.m4a` files in `public/lofi-pixel-study/`. It uses FFmpeg's two-pass loudness normalization, targets -14 LUFS, and writes new files to `public/lofi-pixel-study/normalized/`. Existing output files are skipped.

```bash
# See which files would be processed
pnpm normalize:lofi --dry-run

# Normalize the files
pnpm normalize:lofi

# List every available option
pnpm normalize:lofi --help
```
